After backgrounds and songs, age ratings and icons are also two attentive factors.</p><h3>Age Ratings And All Icons</h3><p>Age ratings and icons are the next two features mentioned in this section. Let's learn about them together with the following details.</p><p>In terms of age ratings, GD Lite is suitable for all ages. This game does not contain violence or inappropriate content for children. However, this Geometry Dash Lite game requires certain concentration and skills to pass difficult levels. Therefore, children will face more challenges than adults. However, this Geometry game is an ideal entertainment environment to train children's reflexes. Before starting to play GD Lite, players should consider their personal abilities and preferences to choose the appropriate level. This Lite version has many levels with different difficulties, so they will be suitable for different ages.</p><p>In terms of icons, Geometry Dash Lite uses simple icons to represent the game. You can see the typical icon of this GD Lite game above. This icon has a simple shape with a square "cube", a triangle "sharp spike", and the word "Lite". Each image represents a specific element: a character, obstacle, and version. This simple icon helps create a clean design for the game.</p><p>The icons and age ratings in GD Lite play an important role in providing a suitable game for players. These two factors are evident across all online platforms. However, very few players know about an element, called Secrets.</p><h3>Geometry Dash Lite All Secrets</h3><p>This platforming game has a number of secrets that players can discover and unlock. These secrets are related to hidden areas or special achievements in the game. Let's learn about some of the secrets you can find in GD Lite.</p><p>The first secret is the unlock code.

This secret will be explored in detail in the Coin Locations section below.</p><p>Next, this GD Lite game also has a Demon level, a special level in Geometry Dash with high difficulty. Players need to unlock this level, but there is no information to unlock it yet. To unlock the Demon level, this Geometry game requires exploration through 15 levels. In addition, Practice mode is also a secret. Although players can easily access this mode, it is often forgotten. Practice Mode allows players to practice all levels without having to start from scratch. You can access this mode by clicking the "Practice" button on the level select screen. This useful mode allows players to set checkpoints from which they can start.</p><p>Note that Geometry Dash Lite is a free version and some secrets are limited compared to the full Geometry Dash version. However, the game still brings enough fun for players. Let's collect coins and discover all the secrets that GD Lite has to offer!</p><h2>All GD Lite Levels</h2><p>All GD Lite levels are classified into 6 types. Easy levels include Stereo Madness and Back on Track while normal levels are Polargeist and Dry Out. Base after Base and Can't Let Go are hard levels while Jumper, Time Machine, and Cycles are harder levels. Insane levels with extreme challenges include XStep, Clutterfunk, Theory of Everything, Electroman Adventures, and Electrodynamix. The most challenging level in this game is Clubstep which features demon difficulty. There are a total of 15 levels in Geometry Dash Lite and they are all arrow levels. These levels all focus on platforms and arrow-using controls. Let's learn about some popular GD Lite levels.</p><h3>Popular GD Lite Levels</h3><p>Among the 15 levels, some famous levels are Back on Track, Base after Base, Clubstep, and Dry Out. These 4 levels attract many online players. Why are they more attractive than other levels in GD Lite?</p><p>Back on Track is one of the original levels in GD Lite. When you join Back on Track, you can enjoy a sci-fi theme with sharp images and simple colors. The difficulty of this level is easy to suit new players. This Back on Track level has simple moving paths and basic obstacles. Besides, dynamic electronic music and fast rhythm create a unique Back on Track level.</p><p>Base after Base is the next level in Geometry Dash Lite. This next level has a technology and space theme with bright and high-contrast colors. Base after Base has increased difficulty compared to Back on Track. Players will encounter more complex paths and more challenging obstacles. Electronic music continues to be the background sound for this Back on Track level.</p><p>Clubstep is one of the famous and difficult levels in GD Lite. The Clubstep theme is electronic music and nightclubs with colorful colors and unique designs. This third level is famous for its high difficulty and fast pace. This Clubstep level requires players to have skill and quick reactions to overcome moving obstacles and complex paths. Vibrant electronic music and club- rhythms help create a fiery state for players.</p><p>Dry Out is another outstanding level in GD Lite. The theme of this level is desert and space with 2 main colors: orange and black. Dry Out has a high level of difficulty, so players have to have precise control skills and jump timing to overcome complex obstacles. This Dry Out level features twisting paths, moving obstacles, and other challenging elements. Electronic music still appears to bring an exciting atmosphere during playing.</p><p>All levels of Geometry Dash Lite have unique themes and features. As you can see above, these 4 levels are completely different in terms of themes, designs, and challenges. Although they bring many challenges to all players, there is no the hardest level in this list. The most significant level is the hardest level, called Electrodynamix.</p><h3>The Hardest Level In Geometry Dash Lite</h3><p>The hardest level in GD Lite is Electrodynamix with 15 stars. All players face difficulties in passing Electrodynamix because this level requires quick reaction skills to perform complex movements.</p><p>To explain the difficulty of Electrodynamix, there are several reasons as follows.</p><ul><li>Speed and complexity: Electrodynamix features fast movement and twisting obstacles. To conquer the most difficult level, players must face complex paths like a platform maze. It is not easy to explore the entire map in this 15-star level of Geometry Dash Lite.</li><li>Complex obstacles: Electrodynamix has complex moving obstacles and their movements are difficult to remember. Most players cannot complete the 15th level in one go. Players need to practice and remember the challenges through previous games. Thanks to the gained experience, the Electrodynamix level can be conquered more easily.</li><li>Music and visual synchronization: Electrodynamix requires the player to perceive and precisely synchronize actions with the music and images on the screen. If you can accurately sense changes in music, you will also be able to predict changes in obstacles.</li></ul><p>Because Electrodynamix is the most challenging level in GD Lite, so it's not the best level. It's so hard for new players because it requires so many skills. In order to have suitable levels, players can customize new levels.</p><h3>Custom GD Lite Levels</h3><p>Custom Level mode in Geometry Dash Lite allows players to create and share levels created by players themselves. You can create or customize levels in GD Lite. This feature brings creativity and variety to the game. Players can experience new levels and unlimited challenges. You can conquer not only the available levels in the original game but also free levels.</p><p>Thanks to Custom Level mode, players can be creative and build their own levels using the built-in level creator. This tool allows players to create movement paths, obstacles, music, and environments to their liking. Some famous Custom Geometry Games are GD Duelo Maestro, GD Clubstep, GD Black Off, and GD Count to Ten. Once completed, players can share their level with the Geometry Dash Lite community by uploading the level to the homepage. Through that, there is interaction and sharing between players in the community. It also opens up the opportunity to explore creative levels from other Geometry players.</p><p>In short, Custom Levels mode in GD Lite is a great way to enjoy the game in your own way and express your creativity.</p><h2>Play GD Lite Online</h2><p>To play Geometry Dash Lite, all players have to control the cube character. Do you know all about your character in terms of shape, controlling way, and movements?</p><h3>Characters In Geometry Dash Lite</h3><p>Seven characters in GD Lite are Cube, Ball, UFO, Wave, Robot, Spider, and Ship.</p><ul><li>Cube has a simple square shape. Cube moves by jumping on and landing on platforms to avoid obstacles in 15 levels.</li><li>Ball has a circular shape. The ball moves by rolling and jumping over obstacles. After that, the Ball character continues to roll on the platforms.</li><li>UFO has the shape of an alien ship. UFO move by flying up and down to avoid obstacles. You control the UFO by pressing the screen to make the character jump and releasing it to make the character fall.</li><li>Wave has a wavy shape. In Geometry Dash Lite, Wave's control and movement are similar to the UFO character.</li><li>Robot has the shape of a robot. The robot can run on platforms and jump over obstacles.</li><li>Spider is shaped like a spider with 4 legs. Like Robot, the Spider character can also run. Players control Spider by pressing the screen for the character to jump and releasing it to continue running.</li><li>The Ship is shaped like a spaceship. Ship's movement and control are similar to UFO and Wave. The ship can fly up and down according to the players' control.</li></ul><p>These GD characters all have unique shapes, controls, and moving ways. When controlling these characters, all players aim for the destination. Besides, collecting coins is also a goal of players.</p><h3>Coin Locations In GD Lite</h3><p>Coins in Geometry Dash Lite are the target items of the players to conquer the game perfectly. As you can know above, there are 3 coins in each level. If you can collect all these coins, you have completed the levels perfectly.</p><p>GD coin has a circular shape and yellow color. The main function of coins is to enhance your achievements and scores in this Geometry game. Each collected coin contributes to your total coin count. These coins can be used to unlock additional features or purchase new characters and backgrounds. However, collecting coins is not easy because they are often placed in hard-to-reach locations. Sometimes, coins are placed in the most difficult parts of the level. You must make quick and precise movements to be able to pick up the coins.</p><p>To make collecting coins easier, you can track their location with each attempt. It is difficult to locate each coin because coin positions may change at each level.
